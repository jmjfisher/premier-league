            <h1>Just how <i>English</i> is the English Premier League?</h1>
            
            <h3>An analysis of Premier League players over time</h3>
            
            <p id='author'><a href="https://jmjfisher.com/" target="_blank">JohnMark Fisher</a> - August 2019</p>
            
            <p>The 2019 UEFA Champions League Final was was a moment of pride for England's Premier League as it was just the second time in which two English clubs faced-off (the other being in 2008), an all English final. While I was watching it I had a fleeting thought: "Just how <i>English</i> is the English Premier League?" My favorite club, Liverpool FC, who were playing in that game were led by the attacking trio of Mane, Salah, and Firmino and backed in defense and in goal by van Dijk and Alisson respectively. These five players, arguably Liverpool's finest if not their most famous, are not English.</p>
            
            <img id="lfc" src="img/lfc.jpg">
            
            <p>During the final between these two English clubs only 10 of the 28 players (35%) that set foot on the pitch in Madrid were English. This proportion is in line with the overall English representation in the Premier League today. Since the Premier League was renamed as such before the 1992-1993 season, the percent of total league minutes played by English players has <b>decreased from 68% to 33%</b>.</p>
            
            <p>To derive those values, player specific data were <a href="https://github.com/jmjfisher/python-tasks/tree/master/Premier_League_Scraping" target="_blank">scraped</a> from Sports Reference's <a href="https://fbref.com/" target="_blank">football/soccer database</a> and summarized to the national team level. With all data, there are a few things to note and keep in mind before continuing:</p>
            
             <ul>
                 <li>The Premier League currently has 20 clubs playing 38 games each. The seasons beginning in years 1992-1994 had 22 clubs playing 42 games each. Those seasons' totals were normalized against the average number of total minutes per season since, roughly 750,000 minutes, to be accurately included in this analysis.</li>
                 <li>Players from nations that no longer exist were evaluated and reassigned to a modern equivalent. For example, Slavisa Jokanovic was born in and represented Yugoslavia. His birth city of Novi Sad, SFR Yugoslavia is within modern Serbia, and thus he was reassigned as such. A similar example is USSR to Russia.</li>
                 <li>There is not always a direct relationship between birth country and nationality/national team. One only has to remember the number of players born in Germany that represented team USA when Klinsmann was running the show to know this is true.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Now, let's dive into it!</p>
            
            <div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1564491978780' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt=' ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Pr&#47;PremierLeaugeEnglishPlayersMinutes&#47;MinutesPlayedbyEnglishPlayers&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='PremierLeaugeEnglishPlayersMinutes&#47;MinutesPlayedbyEnglishPlayers' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Pr&#47;PremierLeaugeEnglishPlayersMinutes&#47;MinutesPlayedbyEnglishPlayers&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /></object></div>                <script type='text/javascript'>                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1564491978780');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.47)+'px';                    var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);</script>
            
            <p>Things are not looking great for English players wanting to play in the Premier League. In the normalized 1992-1993 season they accounted for 511,204 minutes. Last season? Only 224,821... a 56% drop. The slope of the overall trend line is -9859, meaning each successive season English players are playing 9,859 fewer minutes. If accounting for a full game played, 90 minutes, across the league English players are playing 109.5 fewer games each season. However, all is not lost. The league's front office seemed to have noticed this trend and started to enforce the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homegrown_Player_Rule_(England)" target="_blank">Homegrown Player Rule</a>" before the 2010-2011 season. If we break this up and compare the trend lines before and after the rule's implementation we see it may be responsible for some leveling out: -14779 and -3781 respectively (you may replicate this yourself if you lasso data points on the chart to create new trend lines).</p>
            
            <p><i>If English players are not playing as many minutes as they used to, who is filling their void?</i></p>
            
            <div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1564493093555' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt=' ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Pr&#47;PremierLeagueOtherNationsMinutes&#47;NumberofDistinctNationsandTheirMinutesPlayed&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='PremierLeagueOtherNationsMinutes&#47;NumberofDistinctNationsandTheirMinutesPlayed' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Pr&#47;PremierLeagueOtherNationsMinutes&#47;NumberofDistinctNationsandTheirMinutesPlayed&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /></object></div>                <script type='text/javascript'>                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1564493093555');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.47)+'px';                    var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);</script>
            
            <p>Though English players only accounted for 225,000 minutes played during the most recent season, no other individual country has ever tallied more than 70,000 in a season. The highest total for any single country in a season belongs to France in 2002-2003. With a sum of 69,341, Nicolas Anelka, Thierry Henry, William Gallas, Youri Djorkaeff, and Sylvain Distin represented <i>Les Bleus</i> quite well with over 3,000 minutes each.</p>
            
            <p>We may start to get a clearer picture of why this is happening when we look at the number of distinct nations represented. In the 1992-1993 season, players from 30 nations stepped onto the pitch during a game. In 2018-2019, that number jumps up to 65 (this peaked in 2012-2013 at 75). When compared with Europe's remaining "Big Five" leagues, the Premier League was the most diverse of the bunch during the 2018-2019 campaign.</p>

            <p><i>Alright, no single nation is making a profound impact on England's decreasing representation in its own league as it is getting more diverse overall, but which nations are having the strongest impacts?</i></p>
            
            <p>For this calculation I filtered the nations down to those that have an average number of total minutes played of at least 1% (75,000) throughout the history of the league. I then calculated the percent change in those nations' straight average minutes played with their recent or weighted average minutes played (2018 minutes * 27 + 2017 minutes * 26 + ... + 1992 minutes * 1 / 378).</p>

            <p>The Red Devils of Manchester United racked up numerous titles and the Belgian Red Devils are filling the lineup sheets. Meanwhile, Scandinavian, British Isles, and former British colony nations are losing ground. When inspecting the other side of the chart, notice it is littered with nations that have found major success in the last five FIFA World Cups. These include champions (France, Germany, Spain, and Brazil), runners-up (Netherlands, Argentina, France, and Germany), and third-place finishers (Belgium, Netherlands, and Germany). Coincidence?</p>
            
            <p>It is safe to say the Premier League is <i>English</i>, but rather than these players holding a majority representation - the last time being the 1996-1997 season - they now maintain a plurality. I stay out of politics, but I am curious about the rumored impacts of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2019/feb/14/how-might-brexit-affect-premier-league" target="_blank">Brexit</a> on the Premier League's ability to recruit and retain foreign players and how those changes will impact these figures in the future.</p>
